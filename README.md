# Policy and Value Transfer for Lifelong RL
Code for experimenting with transfer approaches to lifelong RL, attached to our 2018 ICML paper "Policy and Value Transfer for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning" (pdf coming soon).

Experiments require [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl), which can be installed with the usual:

	pip install simple_rl

To reproduce all of our plots, use _run_all_learning_experiments.py_ (Figure 3), or _run_all_policy_experiments.py_ (Figure 2).
