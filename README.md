# Policy and Value Transfer for Lifelong RL
Code for experimenting with transfer approaches to lifelong RL, attached to our 2018 ICML paper [Policy and Value Transfer for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning](https://david-abel.github.io/papers/pol_val_transf_icml_18.pdf)

Experiments require [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl), which can be installed with the usual:

	pip install simple_rl

To reproduce all of our plots, run _run_all_policy_experiments.py_ (Figure 2), _run_all_learning_experiments.py_ (Figure 3 -- you must choose your learning algorithm in the file to generate Figures 3 (a,d), (b,e), or (c,f)).
